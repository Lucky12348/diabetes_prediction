# Exploratory data analysis

Here's what I'm going to do step by step in my book.

## Loading data
1. read the csv
2. check the structure
3. verify data types

## Check if we have missing values
- if <span style="color: red;">Missing values</span> removal or imputation

## Statistics
1. view graphically the datas 
2. get the mean, min, max..
3. detect the potential outliers

## Showing the distribution
1. examine variable distributions
2. check for anomalies

# Correlation
-  get typical and extreme values

## Relationship
1. check if a variable has a significant impact
2. and finally to get the characteristics that are important for predicting
