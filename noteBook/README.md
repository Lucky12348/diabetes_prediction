# Exploratory data analysis

Here's what I'm going to do step by step in my book.

## Loading data
1. read the csv
2. check the structure
3. verify data types

## Check if we have missing values
- if <span style="color: red;">Missing values</span> removal or imputation

## Statistics
1. view graphically the datas 
2. get the mean, min, max..
3. detect the potential outliers

## Showing the distribution
1. examine variable distributions
2. check for anomalies

</br>

# Prepare the model

## data standardization
1. get the correlation with diabetic
2. if datas have low correlation ? interactions between variables
3. standardization and save

## Create model
1. logistic regression
2. Random forest
3. XGBoost

## Compare the performances
use metric like F1-Score ore Accurancy to get the best model
